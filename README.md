# CMPE150 – Introduction to Computing Projects

This repository contains a collection of programming projects developed for the CMPE150 course at Boğaziçi University.  
The course introduces fundamental concepts of programming using Python, covering file I/O, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic data structures. Each project demonstrates core programming techniques, problem-solving, and clean code practices.

## Projects

### 1. Image Processing Tool
A grayscale image editor supporting the `.pgm` format. Implements operations such as:
- Column/row sorting
- Region-based sorting with border detection
- Convolution with 3x3 kernels
- File I/O handling without external libraries

Located in: `image-tool/`

### 2. G-Doku Solver
A console-based puzzle game based on a generalized version of Sudoku.  
Includes:
- Move validation logic
- State checking (valid/incomplete/solved)
- Interactive command system

Located in: `gdoku/`

---

### 3. ASCII Animation: Chasing Cars
Simulates a frame-by-frame ASCII animation of a car chasing a person.  
Demonstrates:
- Character-level rendering
- Frame logic and canvas updates
- Collision and occlusion handling

Located in: `animation/`
